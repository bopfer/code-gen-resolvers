# code-gen-resolvers

This repo is to show an issue with code generation for my resolvers.  I can only get them to work by casting them to `IResolvers`.   I am not sure if it is a bug, something I am doing wrong, or just the only way to make it work.

The setup is a bare minimal repo to show the problem.

Refer to `src/schema/index.ts` for more details.
